# Data for my Fifa 22 career mode
I am storing and analysing data for my FC Barcelona career mode, starting from the 25/26 season.

## Data
Data is stored (in Json format) on both players and matches.

### Match data
Data is stored on matches from the Champions League, Copa del Rey and La Liga.
Data is not stored on friendlies, such as pre-season, Copa Europe and the Supercopa.

The match data is split up into three Json files depending on the competition they were played in.

Notes:

- The key passes stat is kinda useless as it is down to style of play, so my team will always have a higher number
- Fifa's xG model is a bit crap, it's xG values are often alot higher than they should be (I have seen shots with 1 xG)
- If a goal is scored by the opposing team, the "Scorer" and "Assister" values will be null as data is not kept on non-Barcelona players
- The Id increments by one each game, with the sequence following through every competition
